## 🚀 Quick Test - Try It Right Now!

### Test in a New Project

1. **Create a test directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/strix-test-project
   cd ~/strix-test-project
   ```

2. **Copy the skills**:
   ```bash
   cp -r ~/Projects/amdtest/.claude .
   ```

3. **Open in Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. **In Claude Code, type**:
   ```
   @strix-halo-setup
   ```

Claude will now guide you through setting up a complete Strix Halo project!

### Or Test the Automated Script

```bash
cd ~/Projects/amdtest
./setup_new_project.sh
```

Follow the prompts to create a new project with everything configured.

## 📤 Publishing to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `strix-halo-skills` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "Claude Code skills and utilities for AMD Strix Halo (Ryzen AI MAX+ 395)"
4. Make it **Public** (so others can benefit)
5. **Don't** initialize with README (you already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code

```bash
cd ~/Projects/amdtest

# Add your GitHub repo as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/strix-halo-skills.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Update README

After pushing, update the README on GitHub with your actual username:

```bash
# Edit README.md and replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
sed -i 's/YOUR_USERNAME/your-actual-username/g' README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update GitHub username in README"
git push
```

## 🌍 Sharing with Others

Once on GitHub, others can use it by:

### Method 1: Clone and Use Script
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/strix-halo-skills.git
cd strix-halo-skills
./setup_new_project.sh
```

### Method 2: Copy Skills to Existing Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/strix-halo-skills.git /tmp/strix
cp -r /tmp/strix/.claude your-project/.claude
```

### Method 3: Git Submodule
```bash
cd your-project
git submodule add https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/strix-halo-skills.git .strix-halo
ln -s .strix-halo/.claude/skills .claude/skills
```
